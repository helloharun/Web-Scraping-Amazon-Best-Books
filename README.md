# Web Scraping - Amazon Best Books

#  Overview
This project is a web scraping script that extracts the best books from Amazon's website. The script uses BeautifulSoup,requests, lxml, and regex to navigate and parse the HTML content of the webpage.  The extracted data includes the book title, author, price, rating, and number of customers who rated.  The data is then stored in a CSV file for further analysis. Further, the project also contains some EDA  (Exploratory Data Analysis) to understand the distribution of the data.
